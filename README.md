# Python online anonymous chat room
- en [English](README.md)


This is an online anonymous chat room based on **Python**. The current version is Ver0.0.2.
There are still some bugs, please understand

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

This repository contains server (sever.py) and client (clinet.py)
Normally use the direct download release version of the **official chat server** (if it cannot be connected, it means that the server has not been opened. Wait for the weekend. It is recommended that **people who chat with friends online 24 hours a day and do not save chat data set up their own server* *)

If you need to **build a third-party server independently**, please go to [Self-built server tutorial](https://github.com/Welsonpeaches/Python_Chat_Room/blob/main/Server/%E8%87%AA%E6%90 %AD%E6%9C%8D%E5%8A%A1%E5%99%A8%E6%95%99%E7%A8%8B-CN.md)


Finally, thank you for using the code in this repository
Thanks!
